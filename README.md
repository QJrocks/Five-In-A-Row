An implementation of the Five In A Row Board game, including computer opponents.

Arrow keys to move the cursor, Z to place a piece.

The numbers on the field show the weights for each space (for debugging the computer logic).

Some other debug keys:
X will place a piece of the other player (not very helpful if you're trying to win)
1 and 2 (the non-numpad ones) will reset the board and set it up with different layouts.
Holding shift will display a different set of numbers. The default set is the amount of value the player will gain from placing a piece in that spot. The alternate set is the amount that the enemy will gain.

Future plans for improving the project:
-Proper modes for multiple computer difficulties, and player vs player and computer vs computer matches
-Icons showing "danger tiles" that would otherwise cause a loss if not taken that very turn
-Audio
-Networked multiplayer?
